      <p>
        An <strong>equation</strong> is a mathematical "sentence" that states
        two expressions are equal. It's like a perfectly balanced scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        While an <strong>expression</strong> is just a phrase (like{" "}
        <code>x + 3</code>), an <strong>equation</strong> is a complete
        statement that can be "solved" (like <code>x + 3 = 5</code>).
      </p>

      <LessonHeader icon={Goal} title="The Goal: Isolate the Variable" />
      <p>
        When we "solve" an equation, our goal is to find the one value for the
        variable that makes the equation true. To do this, we need to get the
        variable (like <code>x</code>) all by itself on one side of the equals
        sign.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is called <strong>isolating the variable</strong>.
      </p>

      <p className="!text-xl !font-semibold !leading-relaxed text-amber-200/90">
        "Whatever you do to one side of an equation, you MUST do to the
        other side."
      </p>
      <p>
        If you add 2 to the left side, you must add 2 to the right side. If
        you divide the left side by 5, you must divide the right side by 5.
        This keeps the equation "balanced."
      </p>
      <p>
        Try it yourself. This applet shows the equation{" "}
        <code>x + 3 = 5</code>. Your goal is to get <code>x</code> by itself.
        See what happens when you add or remove blocks from both sides.

      <p>
        So how do we get <code>x</code> by itself? We use{" "}
        <strong>inverse operations</strong> to "undo" the numbers around it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Addition (<code>+</code>) and Subtraction (<code>-</code>) are
          inverses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Multiplication (<code>Ã—</code>) and Division (<code>Ã·</code>) are
          inverses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To solve <code>x + 5 = 12</code>, we need to "undo" the{" "}
        <code>+ 5</code>. The inverse of adding 5 is...{" "}
        <strong>subtracting 5</strong>.
      </p>
